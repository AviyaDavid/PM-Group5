                            <p><strong>What billing or insurance information will I receive?</strong></p>
                            <p>You will receive a copy of your bill. After your insurance has paid, well provide you with a monthly statement of your account.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p><strong>How long will it take to get things settled with the insurance company?</strong></p>
                            <p>Generally, it takes from 45 to 60 days to obtain payment from an insurance carrier.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p><strong>Why am I getting bills from physicians?</strong></p>
                            <p>Each physician who provides professional services will send you a separate bill from his or her office.
                                <br/>
                                These physicians will include:
                                <br/>
                                - your own physician
                                <br/>
                                - other physicians who conducted tests and procedures
                                <br/>
                                - consulting physicians chosen by your primary physician to read and interpret test results.
                                <br/>
                                These physicians may include specialists in anesthesiology, cardiology, emergency medicine, nuclear medicine, pathology, radiology, or urodynamics. You will be responsible for paying these bills as well.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p><strong>I received a notice that my insurance company has paid on my bill -- but I cant understand how they calculated their payment amount. Do you know?</strong></p>
                            <p>If we have received any such information from your insurance company, well be glad to share it with you. However, for answers to any questions about insurance payments, deductibles, or co-payments, you generally need to check with your insurance company.</p>
